Since Lighttpd doesn't support .htaccess files, you'll need to manually
restrict access to some files.
You can use "mod_redirect" like so:

	url.redirect = (
		"^/README.txt$"  => "https://HOSTNAME/",
		"^/COPYING.txt$"  => "https://HOSTNAME/",
		"^/res/config.*$"  => "https://HOSTNAME/",
		"^/res/library.*$"  => "https://HOSTNAME/",
		"^/res/templates.*$"  => "https://HOSTNAME/"
	)

... just make sure to change HOSTNAME to your actual hostname, and to change
"^/" to whatever the root to your insert-coin instance is.
