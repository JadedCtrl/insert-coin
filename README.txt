INSERT-COIN                                          Pls toss tokens, over here
===============================================================================

insert-coin's a lightweight & simple image-uploading and URL-shortening
service. It doesn't have bells and whistles like accounts or cookies, 
JS or tracking... which you might consider good things.
I think they're awful.


----------------------------------------
USAGE
----------------------------------------
Drop everything in a directory on your web-server (root, non-root, it doesn't
matter).
Then, create two directories-- "p/" and "u/"-- that are accessible and
modifiable by your web-server user.
Finally, make a "res/config.php" file (from "res/config.example.php").
Then, profit!
